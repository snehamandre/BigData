Description :

The project tries to build a regression model to predict purchase amount for each customer.The training dataset has the purchase amount for a retail store for selected high volume products.
The store wants to predict how much a customer might spend on a particular high volume product given their spending history and data about the customers like age, gender, occupation etc.,
To achieve this ,the project uses Decision Tree and Random Forest regressors.
The sample data is in the data folder.The files are outputted to the data folder.

Special Instructions:

This problem is taken from a contest on Analytics Vidhya website and after predicting the purchase amount the data is uploaded to the website to get the regression(RMSE) score.
The project produces a csv file which has the User_ID,Product_ID and predicted Purchase amount.This csv is uploaded to get the RMSE score.
The csv file is to be uploaded to the link(solution checker in the link):

The small data files are located in: /project696/data/sample/

The complete files can be downloaded below links,

The analysis and the ML modeling has been done on the complete data, hence the results will vary for the sample data.
